# Quadrature-Encoder-with-STM32F401
This is a basic code to test Quadrature Encoders for rapid prototyping and verifying the hardware 

The code to unwrap encoders (avoid overflow) was taken from [Stack Exchange - How to increase STM32 Timer (encoder mode) counter value?](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/605278/how-to-increase-stm32-timer-encoder-mode-counter-value)
